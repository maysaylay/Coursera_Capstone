    "##### In this project, I will be comparing the similarities and differences between neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto. This project will shed some light on how these two cities that are respectively financial capitals of two countries in North America compare. Furthermore, I will use two different methodology for segmenting the neighborhoods. These will both k-means clustering and DBSCAN. The use of both methods will allow for comparison of the results from both methods thereby showing their strenghts and weaknesses. \n",
