    "##### In this project, I will be comparing the similarities and differences between neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto. This project will shed some light on how these two cities that are respectively financial capitals of two countries in North America compare. k-means clustering will be used to cluster the different venues in these neighborhoods. Because of the size of the broughs in these cities, Manhattan borough will be considered in NY city and boroughs that have toronto in their names will be the boroughs considered in Toronto. \n",
